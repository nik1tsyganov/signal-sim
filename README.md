# Signal Sim

Signal Sim is a paper-only signal desk for US-listed technology, energy, media, and ETF names.

The project will join market data with time-stamped news-intensity features. It will test event-driven and stochastic methods against strict forward-only evaluation.

Start with [the paper-trading and quant research](docs/paper-trading-and-quant.md).

The initial execution target is a local simulated ledger. Alpaca paper is the preferred later broker adapter for cash equities and ETFs. IBKR remains a later option when broader instruments justify its desktop gateway and account requirements.

This repository was prepared through the MAGI Cursor CLI workflow. It must not connect to live money. It contains no trading engine, broker account, broker software, or credentials.

## Run

Rank local fixture events as paper-trade candidates:

```powershell
python -m signal_sim rank --fixtures
```

See [intel sources](docs/intel-sources.md), [paper trading and quant research](docs/paper-trading-and-quant.md), and [alternative data and safety](docs/alt-data-and-safety.md) for the source and safety rules.
